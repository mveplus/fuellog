Steps to Create the Web App

    Set up a basic Flask app: Flask will serve as the web framework.
    Create a JSON database: Store the data in a JSON file.
    Build the web interface with HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Ensure it's responsive for desktop and mobile.
    Create functions to calculate fuel economy: Implement logic to calculate MPG.
    Add functionality to export data to CSV: Provide an option to export data.
    Implement auto-save for the JSON database: Save data automatically to disk.
    Write unit tests: Ensure each function is tested.

Project Structure

Here's a simple project structure:

/fuel_tracker
|-- app.py
|-- static
|   |-- styles.css
|-- templates
|   |-- index.html
|-- data.json
|-- tests
|   |-- test_app.py
|-- requirements.txt


Running the App and Tests

1. Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Run the Flask app: python app.py
3. Run the unit tests: python -m unittest discover -s tests


This setup provides a simple, responsive web application for tracking car fuel consumption and price, calculating fuel economy in MPG, and exporting data to CSV. The application uses Flask for the backend, JSON for data storage, and basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.

First, let's verify the formula and calculation used for MPG. The MPG is calculated as the distance traveled divided by the amount of fuel used in gallons. Here's the formula:

MPG=Distance Traveled (miles)Fuel Used (gallons)MPG=Fuel Used (gallons)Distance Traveled (miles)​

Given:

    Odometer reading difference = 1000 - 900 = 100 miles
    Fuel used = 40 liters, which needs to be converted to gallons (1 liter ≈ 0.264172 gallons).

Fuel Used (gallons)=40×0.264172=10.56688Fuel Used (gallons)=40×0.264172=10.56688

MPG=10010.56688≈9.4635MPG=10.56688100​≈9.4635

The value 9.4635 is accurate, so we need to update the test case to match this calculation. Also, to fix the ResourceWarning, we'll ensure files are properly closed.


The main landing page will display both the input form and the table containing the fuel data. This table will be populated with data from the JSON file, and new entries can be added using the form. The table will update and display the new data after a form submission.

The application now supports editing and deleting entries, confirms deletion, backs up data before deletion or editing, and allows importing and exporting data to/from CSV. Additionally, it includes a restore button to revert to the last backup, and displays data in a responsive table with checkboxes for selection.
